== Usage

First of all you need a Kubernetes cluster. You can access a local installation as
well as a remote Kubernetes master. Make sure you have the proper configuration
under `Ëœ.kube/config`.

Now you can start and use the Kubepad. Each row represents a Kubernetes deployment, with
the square buttons representing pod instances. Running Pods are green, launching and
pending Pods are yellow, and terminating pods are red. You can start and stop a Pod by
directly pressing a square button. You can also select a row by pressing the buttons on
the right hand side. The cursors at the top can also be used to select the row (up and down)
and scale the row (left and right).

You can also use a connected leap motion to control your Kubernetes cluster. Perform a swipe
gesture to scale to 5 Pods (= 5 fingers). Use key tap or screen tap gestures to move the
row selection down or up.
